        <h2 class="mt0 fw1 sub-headline">WORK</h2>
        <p class="measure-wide">
          I love coding, working with people and learning new technology.
        </p> 

        <p class="measure-wide">
          I've worked in the tech industry since 2006
        </p> 

        <p class="measure-wide">
          My first tech job was at <a target="blank" href="https://kamahi.com">Kamahi Electronics</a> where I worked for 7 years. I was involved with many commercially successful product developments. I built, tested and fixed high end scientific equipment. Designed multi-layer PCBs for <a target="_blank" href="4GAS.pdf">complex</a> <a target="_blank" href="WE32.pdf">mixed</a> <a target="_blank" href="sModule.pdf">signal</a> <a target="_blank" href="HIMUX_XR.pdf">equipment</a>. I used intuition, tenacity and knowledge from mulitple domains to diagnose and fix difficult technical issues. I learned embedded C programming for microcontrollers and my code is running in the wild on <a target="_blank" href="https://antecscientific.com/detectors-and-analyzers/decade-detectors/decade-elite">scientific</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vaakacadence.com/">sporting</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huntersafetylab.com/iris/">safety</a> products.
        </p> 

        <p class="measure-wide">
          While working at Kamahi Electronics my brother and I started a contract electronics manufacturing business to offload Kamahi's production. The business ran for 2 years in which time we produced several hundred research quality scientific instruments for export to The Netherlands. We had a few students working for us on casual contracts and learned a lot. Eventually it got too much as I was still working for Kamahi at the same time and we decided to close down. 
        </p>

        <p class="measure-wide">
          After leaving Kamahi and moving to Wellington I worked as a freelance electronics and embedded developer, often contracting back to Kamahi or <a href="http://www.huntersafetylab.com/">Hunter Safety Lab</a> among others.
        </p>

        <p class="measure-wide">
          Most recently I worked as a facilitating teacher for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devacademy.co.nz/">Enspiral Dev Academy</a>. I taught or helped teach more than 100 developers to code in my time there. I facilitated students through difficult conversations, group conflict, family crises, emotional breakdowns and general bootcamp fatigue. My job required that I role modeled vulnerability and empathetic listening just as much as competently live coding problems in front of a classroom. I love working with teams of people, every team is different and has its own unique character.

        <h2 class="mt0 fw1 sub-headline">TESTIMONIALS</h2>
        <p>I was <a href="http://javascript.org.nz/awards">nominated</a> for javascript educator of the year at <a href="http://conference.javascript.org.nz/">nz.js(con);</a> 2017</p>

        <p>
          "Great dude, great teacher, I learned so much from him. He knew how to articulate and translate information to better my learning!"
        </p>

        <p>
          "Piet is a great developer and it was awesome to have him as a teacher, really knows his stuff (especially when it comes to testing)!"
        </p>

        <p>
          "I have worked with Piet in many different contexts over the last two years. It has always been a pleasure working with him. Piet has high integrity and is very kind and caring. He can communicate his ideas clearly and does so while paying close attention to others. He is a good listener and very empathetic. Piet has the incredible ability to be responsive to the moods and emotions of others with empathy and understanding while still maintaining a balanced and calm demeanour. I have been witness to him dealing with conflict in a very honest and communicative way, he is the first to admit that he has made a mistake and is faultless in his approach to rectifying it. I would recommend Piet as a human and as a developer." 
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was a student at Enspiral Dev Academy last year where Piet was the teacher and I can honestly say I have never met someone so invested on teaching as he is. I will always have the most convoluted questions to ask in class and he will always find time to answer them, to go above and beyond for his students. His devotion to our learning was not only seen on the teaching of Javascript which he did during long day after day, but he also shared with us the classes of engineer's empathy. These classes were about being a better person and getting closer to other people. It was not mandatory for him to be there, to expose himself like that, but he still did it because he thought it was important. I am sure I have learned Javascript the best possible way, as he is quite adamant in all the best practises, but most importantly I learned that you can be an amazing person and work fantastically with others. Thanks to him I can now believe I am a programmer."
