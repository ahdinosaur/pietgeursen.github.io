			<h1>Yes, this is my homework.</h1>
			<p>
				This is my EDA phase 0 week 2 HTML + CSS website. It's my first crack at css. It's fun and painful at the same time. It's pretty easy to get something that looks mostly ok, it's the last 10% where you might lose your mind.

				Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

			<p>
				I used the 'nth-child' css selector to float even quotes right for the mobile layout. I like that. But then of course at some point the screen gets so narrow that the browser breaks this layout. I still need to learn what's going on there. There are some fundamental css layout things I'm not quite grasping yet.
			</p>
			<p>
				I had a problem positioning my quotes. I was trying to float my quote p element left and my character p element right. Now both p tags are display: inline and the character name is positioned relative. Seems nicer.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted to use the 'nth-child' selector on all elements of a class to colour the character names. I grabbed 4 colours from the stars on the bowling alley in the movie and I wanted those colours to repeat each 4 quotes. I couldn't make it work. I think it's because the elements get selected based on their parent elements and the way mine are structured doesn't work out. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I used a colour scheme picker at http://paletton.com/ which was quite fun. I never feel that confident picking colours and this helped. The site is possibly a bit drab but hey. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I managed to find some free versions of the two fonts used in the openeing credits of the movie. I downloaded them and got css to load them from the fonts folder. The open sans font is loaded from google fonts.

				I had to steal a little to make this. The "Dude Abides" image is from skeletonjack666.deviantart.com

				The basic skeleton of the html and css is from the Treehouse "How to make a website" course.
