CSS Tricks:
Try box-sizing: border-box; so you don't have to manaully do margins and borders.

Try adding the .group class to the container of floated elements so they have height.
.group:before,
.group:after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
}
.group:after {
  clear: both;
}
.group {
  *zoom: 1;
}
