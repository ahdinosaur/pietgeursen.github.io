      <h2>
        Based on the video, what's your take on the EDA experience? What is your impression of EDA? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
      </h2>

        Mostly it makes me really really excited. And a little bit nervous. The kitchen vs restaurant idea he uses really made me open up to the experience. It is a big shift in thinking. I loved the story about people turning up to the first bootcamp and helping to put the tables together and setting up the computers. The fact that none of us have to hide our inexperience and the more we can get comfortable being uncomfortable the better we'll all be at building something together.

        When I was thinking about joining EDA, I was worried that maybe I'd have a bit too much coding experience and I didn't want to commit. If I had seen this video first up, I'd have been on board in a flash. The fact he addresses those dual fears (I have both) was a massive relief.

      Bootcamp's philosophy on pairing really rings true to me. In my previous job I worked doing embedded programming (you can think of it as programming for "microchips") and we never collaborated on projects. I seldom had anyone to toss ideas around with, I shouldered a lot of responsibility to make progress and sometimes I could barely talk at the end of the day because I'd been in my head so much. I'm really keen to work with others, learn from people who are more experienced and learn how to teach others the concepts I know. That excites me!

        I'm also a pretty shy person and an introvert so it's going to be a good challenge for me to work on my social skills. :)

        I have lots of experience playing around with different programming languages (different building materials) but hardly any experience with the architectural side of development. So I know I'm going to be really challenged on that front.
