        Mostly this video makes me really really excited. And a little bit nervous because I know I'm going to meet my edge over and over and over.

        The kitchen vs restaurant idea is a big shift in thinking. I love the story about people turning up to the first bootcamp and helping to put the tables together and setting up the computers. We're all responsible for building something together.

        When I was thinking about joining EDA, I was worried that maybe I'd have a bit too much coding experience and I didn't want to commit. If I had seen this video first up, I'd have been on board in a flash. The fact he addresses those dual fears (I have both) is a massive relief.

        I have lots of experience playing around with different programming languages (different building materials) but hardly any experience with the architectural side of development. It's easy to self teach languages but I really think you need to learn the art of software engineering from others. I like that it has such a massive social component, it's not what you expect.

        Bootcamp's philosophy on pairing really rings true to me. In my previous job I worked doing embedded programming (you can think of it as programming for "microchips") and we never collaborated on projects. I seldom had anyone to toss ideas around with, I shouldered a lot of responsibility to make progress and sometimes I could barely talk at the end of the day because I'd been in my head so much. I'm really keen to work with others, learn from people who are more experienced and learn how to teach others the concepts I know. That excites me!

        I'm also a bit shy with new people so it's going to be a good challenge for me to work on my social skills. :)
