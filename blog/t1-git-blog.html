          What are the benefits of version control?

          Version control is a way of saving and keeping track of changes to files in a project. At first that might not sound like much, after all most people make occasional copies of stuff they're working on anyway. But version control takes that idea a whole lot further. Version control makes it easier to revert back to some earlier state if something goes wrong. 

          The other great thing about version control is that it makes it HEAPS easier to share your work and collaborate with others.

          Mostly version control gets used by programmers and developers but there are heaps of projects that can benefit from it. http://soundsoftware.ac.uk/why-version-control has a good flow diagram of whether or not you should consider using version control if you're not a programmer.

          The reason programmers use version control is that software development is a surprisingly organic process. Projects grow in strange ways. Things branch off and flourish and need to be reincorporated. Or more likely they branch off and die and go nowhere. :) Humans are messy and need to be allowed to make mistakes to be creative. We need to iterate over problems to make progress. Version control helps you work on projects like this without going insane.

          Git
          Git is the flavour of version control system we'll look at but there are lots of others. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revision_control_software for a big old list.


          How does git help you keep track of changes?


          Why use GitHub to store your code?
